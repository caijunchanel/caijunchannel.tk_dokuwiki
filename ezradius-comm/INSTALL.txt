Requirements:
1. Apache 2
2. PHP 4 or above
3. MySQL 3 or above
4. GNU/Linux (not tested on BSD's)

Assumption:
1. FreeRADIUS configured to use MySQL as a backend database
2. Apache DocumentRoot is /var/www
3. you have root permission
4. PHP have file operations(fopen, fclose, fwrite, unlink) permission

Before you begin:
1. reading log files need 'adm' permission granted to 'www-data' (apache user), that is, in /etc/groups, 'www-data' must be listed in 'adm' group
2. users are authenticated using PAP module/protocol, see further below how to setup.
3. to use 'kick user' feature, you must start Chillispot with coaport option, see below.

Installation:
1. extract all files in /var/www, make sure all ezRADIUS files owned by 'www-data' or whoever that run Apache server (chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/ezradius-intl)
2. access ezRADIUS using your webbrowser, default username is admin and the password is admin
3. You'll be redirected to configuration page, edit administrator username adn password, freeRADIUS version, and MySQL parameters(host, database name, username and password)
4. done!

Upgrading:
1. If you want to upgrade, just overwrite old files with the new ones, don't forget to reconfigure.

***********************************User login setup***********************************
I forget to mention that FreeRADIUS must use MD5 to encrypt the user's password AND the user must authenticate using PAP protocol. 
       
What FreeRADIUS version do you have? 
==================================== 
If you use FreeRADIUS below 1.1.4, then edit /etc/freeradius/radiusd.conf  
line 569 the default is: 
      encryption_scheme = crypt 
change into this: 
      encryption_scheme = md5 
And the user must have: 
      AuthType := PAP 
in their RadCheck OR RadGroupCheck attributes 
See the detail on forum: http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1985176&forum_id=797965
====================================
If you have FreeRADIUS version 1.1.4 or above, then edit /etc/freeradius/radiusd.conf: 
Line 577 make sure it says:  
      auto_header = yes 
in 'authorize' section make sure you list 'pap' last in this section. 
No need to add AuthType attribute in their RadCheck or RadGroupCheck, FreeRADIUS will handle this 
====================================

*********************************Using 'kick user' feature****************************
Before you can 'kick'/force user to logout, you must make sure that Chillispot are running using --coaport option.

I'm using Debian etch. First we have to edit Chillispot daemon startup script so he start with --coaport option.:

    * open you favorite editor to edit /etc/init.d/chillispot
    * find DAEMON_ARGS variable, change into this:

DAEMON_ARGS="--coaport 3779 --conf /etc/chilli.conf"

    * save the file
    * now open /etc/chilli.conf with your editor, add the following line at the end of file:

coaport 3779

    * save the file, then restart Chillispot(/etc/init.d/chillispot restart).

I create this apps with Dreamweaver CS3 under Windows (and Dreamweaver 8 under Linux) and sorry there's no documentation yet!
